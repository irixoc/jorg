# JSON Organizer (jorg)

I was having a bit of trouble visualizing the structure of large minimized json files, so I made a package that indents these json files and drops them into a file called indented.json. Something like this probably already exists, but I figure it'd be a fun exercise to get a bit more comfortable with go.
